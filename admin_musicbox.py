# Setup: 
# pip3 install beautifulsoup4
# pip3 install soco
# pip3 install pysftp
#
# change the directory paths in syncLocalDBWithRemote()


#Todos: 
# + incorporate getPandoraURI and getSpotifyURI into a single script
# + sync remote playlist db locally periodically
# + script to upload playlist db to remote
# - add "replace db entry with something new" functionality
# - Remove playlist and decommission an NFC tag. 
# + figure out how to get NFC tag ID into the DB.
# - modify so this script can run on the pi or on your local computer (and paste in NFC id)
